# 2DcarGameHillClimbRacing

this is a (as the title already tells) 2D game where you have to face an endless hilly terrain.
There is no other goal than getting as many points as possible.
To try the game you need to install blender and run the 2D_carGame.blend file.
If you want the textures, the "textures" folder need to be in the same folder.
