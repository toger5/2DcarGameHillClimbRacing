# 2DcarGameHillClimbRacing

This is a (as the title already tells) 2D game where you have to face an endless hilly terrain.
There is no other goal than getting as many points as possible.
To try the game you need to install blender and run the 2D_carGame.blend file. Than just press the "P" button and the game should start.
If you want the textures, the "textures" folder needs to be in the same folder. 
All the scripts are packed into the blend file. If you are interested how they look just open the look at them with blenders internal text editor.
